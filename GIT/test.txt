# test.txt - Git Practice File

This file is used to practice various Git commands like diff, stash, commit, amend, and more.

== Section 1: Initial Commit ==
This is the initial content of the file.
Learning Git is fun and powerful.

== Section 2: After First Change ==
You can track file changes using 'git diff'.
'git commit -a -m' allows committing staged and tracked files.

== Section 3: Stash and Rebase ==
Git stash temporarily saves changes.
Git rebase helps to maintain clean commit history.

== Section 4: Tagging and Patching ==
Tagging helps mark versions like v1.0.
Git format-patch is useful for sending commits as email patches.

== Section 5: Branching and Reset ==
'git checkout -b' creates new branches like dev, qa.
'git reset' and 'revert' are powerful but should be used carefully.
